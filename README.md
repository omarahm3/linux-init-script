# Lazy Squirrel Initializer Script (LSIS)

This python script should help easily open your daily use programs or/and development servers on Linux systems (that's what I've tested it on, so far). In case of any power outage, or unexpected shutdown it will be painful to click and walk through your programs and run each and single one of them, so this should help you get it together at one place and RUN THEM ALL!

## Install it!

`pip install lazysqiurrel`

### Use it!

You'll only need to do two things

1. Just run `$ lazysqiurrel --help` wherever you are

2. Contribute, or report me if you feel that there is something needs to be changed or added.
